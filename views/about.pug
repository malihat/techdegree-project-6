            | I have a background in biology and some computer science. I was always afraid of learning programming because I thougth that it is very difficult. 
            | But after completing the projects, I have acquired much knowledge and experience in programming. Now I feel confident calling myself a full stack developer who
            | is eager to learn more and build productive applications.
