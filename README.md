## Static Node.js and Express Site
This project is about a portfolio site to show the projects. The project has a landing page that shows all projects, about page that has contact information, and a page for every project which gives a little description about the project. There is also a json file which contains the json data.

## Skills and techniques required to complete the project
I used nodejs and express to build this project. The server, routes and error handling were done using express. Pug templates were used to display the json data on the page. I added the background color and text shadow and changed font styles in style.css file.
